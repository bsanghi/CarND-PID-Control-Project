# CarND-PID-Control-Project
The purpose of this project was to "build a PID controller and tune the PID hyperparameters by applying the general processing flow as described in the lessons," and to "test your solution on the simulator!" The simulator provides cross-track error (CTE), speed, and steering angle data via local websocket. The PID (proportional/integral/differential) controller must respond with steering and throttle commands to drive the car reliably around the simulator track.
