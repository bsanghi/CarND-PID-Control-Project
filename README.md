## Introduction

The purpose of this project was to "build a PID controller and tune the PID hyperparameters by applying the general processing flow as 
described in the lessons," and to "test your solution on the simulator!" The simulator provides cross-track error (CTE), speed, and 
steering angle data via local websocket. The PID (proportional/integral/differential) controller must respond with steering and throttle
 commands to drive the car reliably around the simulator track.

## Rubic Discussion Points

I have used PID controller with twiddle algorithm inside a state machine to optimize P,I, D parameters. The I part of the algorithm was 
ignored because there is no bias. But, i chose small value(0.001) for Ki. 

I lowered default throttle value to 0.2 and reduced more(0.1) when making turns so that it does not oversteer. 

I directly implemented the twiddle algorithm. But, I have to choose reasonable initial values for p and dp. 
Hyperparameters were tuned manually at first. This was necessary because the narrow track left little room for error.

I used 1260*3 steps(around 3 turns) for each iteration to calculate the average error because number of steps for one turns is not 
constant because each iteration has different parameters. By the comparing ave_error2=sum(cte*cte)/number of steps for each iteration, 
we calculated the optimial values. 
It takes almost hundred iterations to satisfy the condition(sum(dp) < 0.2 ) even we choose reasonable values for p.

To run the twiddle optimization, you have to change the value of use_twiddle to True in PID.h. The default value is False.

The final values are :

Kp = 0.60 , Ki=0.001 , Kd=3.07
